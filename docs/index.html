                        in our experience as
                        immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who came to the United States to pursue higher
                        education. Our story is one of hard work, significant challenges, and ultimately, the triumph of
                        strategic planning and purposeful living.</p>

                        Years: Degrees and Debt</h3>
                    <p id="the_early_years_description_1" data-i18n="the_early_years_description_1">Fernando graduated
                        from Penn State with a Computer
                        Science degree in 2015 and immediately began
                        working in his field. This was a significant achievement, but it also marked the beginning of a
                        substantial financial challenge. He carried over $70,000 in student loans, and living alone in
                        the U.S., he was solely responsible for all his expenses. Over time, his debt grew to include
                        auto loans and credit card debt, accumulating to more than $100,000.</p>
                    <p>During this period, my own journey in the U.S. was distinct. I first came to the U.S. in August
                        2017 to study, fortunate enough to receive scholarships that allowed me to avoid student loans.
                        However, I had to return to the Dominican Republic in December 2018 due to visa requirements. I
                        continued to work remotely, and while I visited the U.S. for extended periods starting in 2021,
                        my income was based in the DR and not enough to contribute to expenses in the U.S.</p>

                        Point: A Strategic Plan and
                        Continued Resilience</h3>
                    <p>The pivotal moment came in January 2018. Even before we got married in 2019, we knew we wanted to
                        be prepared for our next step together. We sat down, meticulously analyzed all the numbers, and
                        created a comprehensive, strategic plan to tackle the debt head-on. It was a daunting task, but
                        we were committed.</p>
                    <p>Through disciplined effort and adhering to our new plan, we are incredibly proud to share that we
                        completely paid off all of that debt‚Äîover $100,000‚Äîin just two and a half years, by August 2020.
                        This significant achievement was largely accomplished while Fernando was living alone, managing
                        all his expenses and strategically paying down this substantial debt. This achievement,
                        accomplished even as we navigated getting married, solidified our belief in the power of
                        intentional financial management.</p>
                    <p>However, our financial journey continued to present unique challenges. Although I moved
                        permanently to the U.S. in 2022, I was unemployed for more than six months, attending countless
                        interviews. During this period, Fernando continued to bear the full financial responsibility,
                        supporting both of us until I started working in January 2023. Fortunately, because he had
                        already paid off his significant debt by 2020 and had consistently built up his emergency funds,
                        401(k), and HSA, this period of supporting both of us was not financially difficult. This
                        experience further reinforced our resilience and commitment to our shared financial goals.</p>

                        Learned and Our Current Focus
                    </h3>
                    <p>Our journey wasn't without its detours. We also ventured into real estate investment, purchasing
                        two properties. However, through that experience, we learned that it wasn't the right fit for
                        our vision of Designed Financial Freedom. We decided to sell both properties, understanding that
                        true financial freedom means aligning our investments and spending with what truly matters to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Today, we are heavily invested in our retirement and consciously saving for the experiences and
                        passions that bring us the most joy. We are big on vacations and experiences. This means we
                        purposefully cut back on things that matter less to us, allowing us to plan ahead and spend
                        generously on the trips and experiences we truly want, guilt-free.</p>
