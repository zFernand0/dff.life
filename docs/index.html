                <h2>Our Journey: From Debt to Designed Freedom</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>We are Candy and Fernando, and our financial journey is deeply rooted in our experience as immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who came to the United States to pursue higher education. Our story is one of hard work, significant challenges, and ultimately, the triumph of strategic planning and purposeful living.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Early Years: Degrees and Debt</h3>
                    <p>Fernando graduated from Penn State with a Computer Science degree in 2015 and immediately began working in his field. This was a significant achievement, but it also marked the beginning of a substantial financial challenge. He carried over $70,000 in student loans, and living alone in the U.S., he was solely responsible for all his expenses. Over time, his debt grew to include auto loans and credit card debt, accumulating to more than $100,000.</p>
                    <p>During this period, my own journey in the U.S. was distinct. I first came to the U.S. in August 2017 to study, fortunate enough to receive scholarships that allowed me to avoid student loans. However, I had to return to the Dominican Republic in December 2018 due to visa requirements. I continued to work remotely, and while I visited the U.S. for extended periods starting in 2021, my income was based in the DR and not enough to contribute to expenses in the U.S.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Turning Point: A Strategic Plan and Continued Resilience</h3>
                    <p>The pivotal moment came in January 2018. Even before we got married in 2019, we knew we wanted to be prepared for our next step together. We sat down, meticulously analyzed all the numbers, and created a comprehensive, strategic plan to tackle the debt head-on. It was a daunting task, but we were committed.</p>
                    <p>Through disciplined effort and adhering to our new plan, we are incredibly proud to share that we completely paid off all of that debt—over $100,000—in just two and a half years, by August 2020. This significant achievement was largely accomplished while Fernando was living alone, managing all his expenses and strategically paying down this substantial debt. This achievement, accomplished even as we navigated getting married, solidified our belief in the power of intentional financial management.</p>
                    <p>However, our financial journey continued to present unique challenges. Although I moved permanently to the U.S. in 2022, I was unemployed for more than six months, attending countless interviews. During this period, Fernando continued to bear the full financial responsibility, supporting both of us until I started working in January 2023. Fortunately, because he had already paid off his significant debt by 2020 and had consistently built up his emergency funds, 401(k), and HSA, this period of supporting both of us was not financially difficult. This experience further reinforced our resilience and commitment to our shared financial goals.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Lessons Learned and Our Current Focus</h3>
                    <p>Our journey wasn't without its detours. We also ventured into real estate investment, purchasing two properties. However, through that experience, we learned that it wasn't the right fit for our vision of Designed Financial Freedom. We decided to sell both properties, understanding that true financial freedom means aligning our investments and spending with what truly matters to us.</p>
                    <p>Today, we are heavily invested in our retirement and consciously saving for the experiences and passions that bring us the most joy. We are big on vacations and experiences. This means we purposefully cut back on things that matter less to us, allowing us to plan ahead and spend generously on the trips and experiences we truly want, guilt-free.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why We're Here: Helping You Achieve Your Designed Financial Freedom</h3>

We believe that with the right strategies and a clear understanding of your values, anyone can transform their financial life.</p>
